# ReviewMeBackend
Hello guys. This server was written as a side project to transfer NodeJS code into Python Flask to practice new skills and to see how our project will work when
we have React for frontend and Flask for backend.
I use framework Flask to control server as long as bcrypt and JWT libraries to create token and hashing user's password.
Also, I used psycopg2 to connect with PostgreSQL to post and retrieve data from our database.
